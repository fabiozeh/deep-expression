#### Augmenting the MusicNet Dataset:

The files contained in this folder include information necessary for correctly parsing the MusicNet dataset and running the experiments as designed. Copy them to the root folder of the original raw musicnet dataset (same folder that contains the train_labels and other folders) and the python notebooks should find them without issues.
